# Hello, this is my execution of a Telegram LLM bot - which may or may not be used as an example for AIX's AI engineering course.

## Instruction to run this code:
1. Create a conda environment in the root directory.
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` once inside the environment.
3. Obtain an openai key from the openai website and place it into .env (also remove the .sample suffix)
4. Obtain a telegram key from BotFather in telegram and place it into .env
5. In the root directory, run `python main.py` and go to telegram to interact with the bot.
