TCG Policy
We want to make sure you have all the details you need before you purchase from us. Here are a few things to keep in mind:
All the trading card game packs you buy from us come directly from the manufacturer, sealed and untouched. We don’t open or tamper with any packs.
Each pack is a mystery! The cards inside are completely randomized by the manufacturer, so every pack is a surprise.
Because the contents are randomized, we can’t promise which cards you’ll get. It’s all part of the fun, but it also means we can’t take responsibility for what’s inside.
Once you’ve made your purchase, it’s final. We can’t offer refunds or exchanges on trading card game packs.
We hope this clears things up! If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to our customer service. Happy collecting!
